DevSecOps = Development + Security + Operations
Build software fast like DevOps — but also build it securely at every step
Breaking it down:
| Part                  | Meaning                               | Example                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dev (Development)** | Writing code, building apps           | A developer writes code for a web app               |
| **Sec (Security)**    | Keeping everything safe and protected | Checking the code for security bugs or secret leaks |
| **Ops (Operations)**  | Running and maintaining apps          | Deploying the app to servers, monitoring it         |

Goals and Objectives
The DevSecOps vision is to enable the rapid release of trusted business applications with
• Defined effective and approved DevOps processes
• Reduced overall time to receive an initial Authorization to Operate (ATO)
• Continuous security data available Sprint-to-Sprint to maintain an ATO
• Automated security scanning, monitoring, testing and artifact generation
• Security and privacy risks and issues identified and resolved early in development

Benefits of DevSecOps
• Built-In Security and Privacy. DevSecOps encourages Business Owners to satisfy 
security and privacy requirements as part of their daily DevOps pipeline. 
• ATO Ready. This integrated process rapidly delivers a more secure solution that satisfies 
many of the criteria needed to receive an ATO during development rather than at the end 
of development. 
• Automation. Use of automation eliminates manual tasks, frees staff to work on unique 
problems, and can reduce the total pipeline time to deliver a trusted solution. Examples of 
areas for automation include security scanning, monitoring, and testing. 
• Issues Addressed Earlier. Identifying and removing security and privacy risks and 
issues earlier saves resources and time.

raditional Way (Before DevSecOps)
Developer writes code → 
Operations deploys → 
Security checks happen after everything is done → ❌ (too late!)
If something is unsafe, they find it after deployment. That wastes time and money.
DevSecOps Way
Developer writes code
Security tools automatically scan the code
During CI/CD pipeline
Tools check for security issues (vulnerable libraries, open ports, secrets, etc.)
When deployed
Monitoring tools continuously check for threats

Security is built-in from the start to the end.

Simple Real-Life Example

Imagine you’re baking a cake 
DevOps: Make the cake fast and deliver it quickly.
DevSecOps: Make the cake fast but also make sure it’s safe to eat — check ingredients, oven temperature, hygiene — at every step.
So DevSecOps = speed + safety together.

| Stage                         | Purpose                               | Example Tools                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Code Scanning (SAST)**      | Check code for bugs & vulnerabilities | SonarQube, Checkmarx           |
| **Dependency Scanning (SCA)** | Check for insecure libraries          | OWASP Dependency-Check         |
| **Container Scanning**        | Check Docker images                   | Trivy, Clair                   |
| **Secrets Scanning**          | Find passwords/API keys in code       | GitGuardian                    |
| **Infrastructure Security**   | Check Terraform/AWS configs           | Checkov, Terrascan             |
| **Continuous Monitoring**     | Watch for runtime threats             | AWS GuardDuty, Prometheus, ELK |
